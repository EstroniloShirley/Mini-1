          <h4>Prenatal Check-up</h4>

          <p>
            - Prenatal care is when a mother got check- ups from a doctor,
            nurse, or midwife throughout her pregnancy. It helps keep her and
            her future baby healthy. Babies of mothers who do not get prenatal
            care are three times more likely to have a low birth weight and five
            times more likely to die than those born to mothers who do get care.
            Why is prenatal care important? Prenatal care is an important part
            of staying healthy during pregnancy. The doctor, nurse, or midwife
            will monitor baby’s development and do routine testing to help find
            and prevent possible problems. These regular check-ups are also a
            great time to learn how to ease any discomfort the mother may be
            having, and ask any other questions about her pregnancy and the
            birth of her future baby. When to start having prenatal care
            appointments? Prenatal care started as soon as the mother knew she’s
            pregnant. It’s actually best to go to see a doctor before getting
            pregnant, this is sometimes called pre-pregnancy care or
            preconception planning. But if that’s not possible, prenatal visits
            begin as soon as the mother gets pregnant. How often is prenatal
            care? Prenatal care visit depends on how far along the pregnancy is
            and how high your risk is for complications. The typical prenatal
            care schedule for someone whose 18-35 years old and healthy is:
            Every 4 or 6 weeks for the first 32 weeks Every 2 or 3 weeks for the
            32nd-37th weeks Every week from the 37th week until delivery With
            regular prenatal care mother can:  Reduce the risk of pregnancy
            complications.  Reduce the fetus’s and infant’s risk for
            complications  Help ensure the medications women take are safe. 

            come in for check-ups more often if you have a high-risk pregnancy.

            - Immunization is the process whereby a person is made immune or
            resistant to an infectious disease, typically by the administration
            of a vaccine. Vaccines stimulate the body’s own immune system to
            protect the person against subsequent infection or disease.
            Immunization is a proven tool for controlling and eliminating
            life-threatening infectious diseases and is estimated to avert
            between 2 and 3 million deaths each year. It is one of the most
            cost-effective health investments, with proven strategies that make
            it accessible to even the most hard-to-reach and vulnerable
            populations. It has clearly defined target groups; it can be
            delivered effectively through outreach activities; and vaccination
            does not require any major lifestyle change  Vaccine - A vaccine is
            a type of medicine that trains the body’s immune system so that it
            can fight a disease it has not come into contact with before.
            Vaccines are designed to prevent disease, rather than treat a
            disease once you have caught it. There are 4 main types of vaccines:
            Live-attenuated vaccines- use a weakened (or attenuated) form of the
            germ that causes a disease. Live vaccines are used to protect
            against:  Rotavirus  Smallpox  Chickenpox  Yellow fever 
            Measles  Mumps  Rubella Inactivated vaccines - use the killed
            version of the germ that causes a disease.
